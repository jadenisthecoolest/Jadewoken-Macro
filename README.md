Hello everyone this is my first officaial project posted on giuthub so bare wiht me. The Roblox game the macro is used for is Deepwoken.
This macro currently has a bigger parry cd bar and will hopefully have slidecasting, autoclicker, autocallout on m1, autotext on grip, autorun,
golden tounge macro, and maybe a wiki or helpful tips (If I can figure out freaking data scraping).
